Especially in the field of medical imaging, such as radiology, pathology, ultrasound, etc., artificial intelligence AI technology is playing an important role in promoting the accuracy, consistency, and efficiency of image diagnosis, and promoting the development of medical imaging towards more accurate, standardized, and efficient direction.</p>
       <p class="w3-justify" style="font-style: normal;">China's artificial intelligence AI medical market will continue to grow rapidly in the next decade, and artificial intelligence AI medical imaging (including X-ray, CT, pathology, ultrasound, etc.) will become the fastest growing segment market.</p>
       <img src="https://pic4.zhimg.com/v2-ce1ca2bb526da8e23ccb5fd4b14b9e7f_r.jpg" style="width:75%">
      <p class="w3-justify" style="font-style: normal;">In the field of radiological imaging analysis, artificial intelligence AI technology has been widely used in the screening of diseases such as rib fractures, pulmonary nodules, and pneumonia, with the aim of reducing missed diagnoses and improving the speed and accuracy of diagnosis. At the same time, artificial intelligence AI technology is also used to evaluate diseases such as intracranial hemorrhage, functional myocardial ischemia, coronary artery stenosis, and head and neck artery stenosis, providing decision support for clinical doctors to optimize treatment plans and improve patient treatment outcomes.</p>

      <p class="w3-justify" style="font-style: normal;">Since 2015, the application of artificial intelligence AI in the field of radiographic imaging has developed rapidly. As of July 2022, 6 companies have obtained 7 Class III registration certificates for blood flow-related artificial intelligence AI software; 10 companies have obtained 14 Class III registration certificates for artificial intelligence AI software for lung CT applications; and another 3 companies have obtained 3 Class III registration certificates for bone X-ray applications. This indicates that the performance of these artificial intelligence AI software, including its sensitivity and specificity, has passed the validation of clinical trials and the approval of the Drug Administration, indicating that these products have entered the monetization stage. China's artificial intelligence AI radiographic imaging market is growing rapidly at a compound annual growth rate of 50 to 60%, becoming an important auxiliary diagnostic tool in clinical settings.</p>
      <img src="https://pic3.zhimg.com/v2-39a6760e7ceb56a5d58e53176d37eafa_r.jpg" style="width:75%">
